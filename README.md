# super-resolution

Single image super-resolution (SISR) is an significant idea within image restoration, aiming to recover a high-resolution (HR) copy of an image from its corresponding low-resolution (LR) image.

In this repository, we aim to implement an Efficient Sub-pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN).
